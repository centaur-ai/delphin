Lean DELPH-IN
=============

The long-term goal is to have a complete port of
https://pydelphin.readthedocs.io/ to Lean and even more tools from the
https://github.com/delph-in/docs/wiki. The short-term goal is to port
enough of PyDelphin to allow the port of
http://github.com/ibm/MRS-Logic to Lean.
